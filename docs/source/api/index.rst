PyMOT API
#############
This section attempts to provide a simple browsing experience for the PyMOT
documentation. PyMOT uses legible docstrings, and therefore, all
documentation should be easily accessible in any sensible IDE (or IPython)
via tab completion. However, this section should make most of the core
classes available for viewing online.
